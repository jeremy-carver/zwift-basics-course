This is the description we show on the course page [here](https://lab.github.com/jeremy-carver/zwift-basics).

# Course description

Learn the basics of working with branches in git and github. Branches encourage committing small units of work very often because they are incredibly light weight and merge easily.

# What you'll learn

When you're done, you'll be able to:
- Create a feature branch where you can isolate working.
- Make changes in that feature branch.
- Create a pull request to merge those changes into the parent branch.
- Review the changes on a pull request.
- Resolve a merge conflict.
- Complete the pull request.

# Prerequisites

The [README.md](https://github.com/zwift/zwift-game-client/blob/development/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/zwift/zwift-game-client/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the [zwift-game-client](https://github.com/zwift/zwift-game-client) are good places to start.
